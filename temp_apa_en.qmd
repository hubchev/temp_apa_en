# Abstract {.unnumbered}

\noindent 
This template was created by Prof. Dr. Stephan Huber and is based on the Quarto extension apaquarto [@Schneider2024quarto] and the \LaTeX\ package apa7 [@Weiss2022Formatting]. For the most part, it is designed in accordance with APA stlye (7th Edition) guidelines. However, some adjustments have been made to conform to the formatting requirements specified in the "Handbook of Academic Writing" [@Hildebrandt2019Handbook, Section 4.1.2]. More detailed explanations and examples of use can be found in the PDF “roadshow_apa_en.pdf”.
